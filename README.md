# Transformer-Based-Deep-Coding-Engine-For-Generating-High-Level-Source-Code

“Transformer-based Deep Coding Engine for Generating High Level Source Code” is a system that is capable of automatic generation of C++ source code for any given problem making use of Deep Learning, Transformer architecture, Text Mining and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The Transformer model required for automatic generation of source code is trained using a SPoC dataset containing large number of pseudocode and program pairs. The pseudocode of the problem to be coded is given in a text format via an input section of the GUI created using Django Framework. Then, the text input is passed through the model and C++ source code for the given pseudocode is displayed in the website. The system can generate solutions for base level problems such as arithmetic and string calculations to higher level computations. Transfer learning is also performed on pretrained transformer model, CodeT5, for better performance on pseudocode to C++ source code conversion.
